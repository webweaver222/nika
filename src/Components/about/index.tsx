          <p className="description">
            After graduating Architecture faculty, I worked on my specialty for
            a year, but then I realized that digital design attracts me more.
            Since then I have started to do design, using my old knowledge and
            getting the new ones. Iâ€™ve completed several courses in graphic
            design, UI and UX, and continue my self developing working as a web
            designer for an international company in Tel Aviv.
          </p>

          <p className="description" style={{ marginTop: "45px" }}>
            I came to design from architecture, and this fact had strong
            influence on my thinking. Before creating something new, I allways
            think about user friendliness to build the most comfortable and
            clear user experiance. Besides my current work, in my free time I
            also have my own freelance projects.
          </p>

          <p className="description" style={{ marginTop: "45px" }}>
            For now I am looking for new opportunities for my professional
            growth, which will also help my partners achieve their business
            goals.
